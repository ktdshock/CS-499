# CS-499
SNHU - CS499 - Computer Science/Software Engineering Capstone

Completing the Computer Science program at SNHU and developing my final ePortfolio has allowed me to reflect on my growth as a software engineer and clearly demonstrate the technical and professional skills I have developed throughout the program. Through a combination of coursework, hands-on projects, and iterative improvements to my artifacts, I have strengthened my ability to design, implement, test, and evaluate software solutions that are practical, secure, and aligned with industry standards. This portfolio represents not only my technical capabilities, but also my readiness to enter the software engineering field with confidence.

Throughout the program, I worked primarily in an independent development environment while still engaging in peer review and instructor feedback. This experience helped me develop strong self-direction and accountability while also learning how to evaluate code critically, explain design decisions, and incorporate external feedback into my work. Reviewing peer code and receiving feedback on my own projects strengthened my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly and make informed decisions that improve software quality. These skills are essential in professional development environments where collaboration, even in asynchronous or distributed teams, plays a key role in project success.

A significant area of growth during my coursework was problem solving using data structures and algorithms. Courses focused on algorithms and applied problem solving taught me how to break complex problems into manageable components, evaluate trade-offs between different approaches, and implement solutions that balance efficiency and readability. I learned to apply algorithmic thinking not only to traditional data structure problems, but also to real-world challenges such as decision making, optimization, and state-based logic. This experience strengthened my ability to design computing solutions that are both effective and adaptable.

My work in software engineering and databases further expanded my understanding of application architecture and data management. Through projects involving full stack development, mobile applications, and persistent storage, I gained experience designing modular systems that separate concerns and promote maintainability. I learned how to structure applications in a way that supports future enhancements, testing, and scalability. Working with databases reinforced the importance of data integrity, validation, and efficient data access, as well as the role databases play in supporting reliable and user-focused software systems.

Security awareness became an important supporting skill throughout the program. While security was not always the primary focus of each project, I consistently applied secure coding practices such as input validation, controlled data access, and careful handling of sensitive information. Coursework related to secure coding and system design helped me develop a security mindset that considers potential vulnerabilities during the design and implementation phases rather than as an afterthought. This approach allows me to build software that is more resilient, trustworthy, and aligned with modern development expectations.

The artifacts included in this ePortfolio work together to demonstrate my development as a software engineer across multiple areas of computer science. Each artifact highlights a different aspect of my technical skill set, including software design and engineering, algorithmic problem solving, and database integration. Together, they reflect my ability to design complete systems, reason through complex problems, and implement solutions using appropriate tools and technologies. This portfolio provides a cohesive representation of my skills and serves as a foundation for continued growth as I pursue a professional career in software engineering.
